  <h1>Covid-19 Cases, Deaths, and Tests by Region</h1>

 # <h2> Analysis <h2>
Conducted various forms of statistical analysis in Python including: regression, cluster, geospatial and time-series to form correlations
and analyze different variables and the relationships they have with one another.

# Data Cleaning
Searched for missing values and duplicates, created new variables/columns and merged two separate data sets together so that
I could combine the Covid-19 data set that was by date (covid-19 complete) with the data set which featured various totals by country (full_grouped).
Created new variables such as "% of Population With Covid" and "% of Cases that Result in Death" to further analyze.  Did consistency checks with each
of the data sets.

# Research Questions
How big of an influence does testing have on death rates?  How much influence does region have on cases, deaths and tests?  What countries and regions
have the highest case, death, and testing rates?  How does the number of cases and deaths compare through the first six months with each region?

# Data Sets
The Covid-19 data was found on Kaggle.com and collected by an external source, Worldometer, which is run independently
by an international team of developers, researchers and volunteers.  This data is considered extremely trustworthy with
the UK Government, Johns Hopkins CSSE, amongst many others using it as a source.
